		<h2>What the Website is About</h2>
		<div id="me">
			<p>Hello, my name is Stephen Orendain, and this is my portfolio website. At the top, there is a menu bar that leads to 6 other pages that talk about my expreinces so far. These include, things about me, my work, and contact information. If you are interested in my experience as a first time Web Developer, check it out. I have created this portfolio of mine around January
			and finished at the 29th. By the time the 13th of march came in, it was completely done. The reason why I created this portfolio of mine, was to see the culmination of my learning in my classes in creating this. This is the result of what I made.
