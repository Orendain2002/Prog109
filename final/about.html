		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<div id="about">
			<p>My name is Stephen Orendain. My hobby is to go around places and look for books that interest me. I sometimes do this by going for a walk at night because it is sometimes peaceful and keeps my head occupied on those things. However, there are days when I can't do these because I am a student. I am a Bellvue Colelge Student, currently taking online for my classes. As of right now, the one I am currently taking is a Web Development class, in hopes to design interesting websites, along with the other general classes such as English 201 and Precalculus. In hopes of this, my goal is to get a bachelors in Information Systems and finish all prerequisites to accomplish this.</p>
